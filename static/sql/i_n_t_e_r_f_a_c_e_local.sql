[Three beeps]</blockquote><div>It’s a “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaking_clock\">speaking clock</a>,” an automated electronic announcement which provides the current time. The distinctive voice belongs to Pat Simmons, a former London Telephone Exchange employee who spoke the time from 1963 until 1985. Simmons followed Jane Cain [↓], the “golden voice” of the first British telephone time system starting in 1936.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00007.png\"><br></div><div>That first set up was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rErC-f_ru4c\">a room-sized electric mechanism</a> which produced an automated announcement from glass disk recordings of spoken audio bits. Here is Pat Simmons [↓] recording numbers and sentence fragments.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00006.png\">Dialing “T-I-M” from any UK telephone at the time set this elaborate machine running. Before this, speaking clocks were delivered live by an operator sitting in front of a clock face, answering phone calls, and reading out the time [↓].&nbsp;<br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00008.png\"><br></div><div>Of course what you hear live when you call the number above depends on exactly when you call. The voice, well that’s not so live. Simmons spoke the clock only from 1963 until 1985 and this service is a software simulation run by enthusiasts at <a href=\"https://telephonesuk.org.uk\">telephonesuk.co.uk</a>. Live, recorded, or programmed, a speaking clock is clearly an anachronism. But, it also provides a crisp model for thinking around something quite contemporary: the interface.&nbsp;</div><blockquote>Jane Cain: At the third stroke it will be 8:57 precisely.</blockquote><blockquote>Pat Simmons: At the third stroke it will be 7:02 and forty-seconds.</blockquote><blockquote>Man’s voice: At the third stroke the time sponsored by Accurist will be 10:52 and 10 seconds.&nbsp;<br></blockquote><div>Each has a particular quality and it’s easy enough to imagine those voices as the personality, or even the design, of this interface. Call the speaking clock and you’re interacting with a front end, a “user experience”—you’re given a simple friendly face for a complex process which remains hidden.</div><blockquote>Whatever lies between is called interface. Whatever allows us to link to different elements, to reconcile them, to put them into communication.</blockquote><div>That definition was offered in 1987 by Italian critic Giancarlo Barbacetto in his introduction to <i>Design Interface</i>. The book chronicled the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_S.p.A.\">Olivetti Typewriter Corporation</a>’s early attempts at designing user controls for photocopiers, computers, typewriters, and calculators. Barbacetto places this design task in a broad cultural and temporal context. Appearing opposite his introduction is a reproduction of the Rosetta Stone, offered up as a kind of original, ur-interface—a shared surface which facilitates communication between otherwise irreconcilable languages and cultures. <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-rosetta-stone-1e03509704a3490e99a173e53b93e282\">The Rosetta Stone</a> [↙] records three different languages all relaying the same message. The recovery of this “shared surface” in 1799 allowed the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00009.png\"><br></div><div>Barbacetto continues from the Rosetta Stone to an impossibly broad scoping of the concept of interface and lands on this, a public <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfWz4XwlZOQ\">clocktower in the Piazza San Marco</a> in Venice [↗]. It’s the first public clock and it’s set at the center of a merchant city, where shared time would have significant consequences for shipping and commerce. He goes on,</div><blockquote>An extremely powerful and everyday filter is the clock. The first machine made available to all from high atop a tower ready to interface humans and time. The clock tore humans away from lived time marked by natural rhythms and by the duties of seasonal social labor and delivered into the power of measured time, objective and abstract. The work time of urban merchants, the interest time of the money lender, the factory time of industry. First the bells of the city clocktower, later the mill siren, erased cyclical time that moved, the rhythm of the seasonal return, of a certain kind of game, the ripening of a plant, the dependable rising of the sun. Cyclical time was a great exorcism of death—the moon that returns is the first dead man returning, repetition is the life of the world, history is nothing but the reiteration of a single original event; time is Kronos, the great primordial judge.</blockquote><blockquote>After the arrival of the clock all that became a memory and a myth. Time became linear, homogenous, empty, irreversible, cumulative, oriented towards a goal. Even modern mechanical thought prefers rectilinear motion to circular motion. Clocks mark the separation between work time (the value time of production), and free time, but today even the physicality of the chimes of the clocktower is obscured by the digital information time, the absolute acceleration of the discontinuity in the contemporaneity of computer time.</blockquote><div>Olivetti’s first large computer (built in 1959) was named the Elea, after the colony in Magna Graecia where, in the fifth century B.C. the school of philosophy of Parmenides and Zeno was born. “Elea computer”—the name itself is like saying mathematical rationality and philosophical discourse, algorithm and hermeneutics.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>(“Algorithm and hermeneutics” or in other words, a definite pattern and how things get their meanings.)</div></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><br></div><div><div>Resources</div></div><div><a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/TIME/gjnvwwjegvw/\">Why time feels so weird in 2020</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/geoff-mcfetridge-apple-watch-series-six-art-digital-180920\">Geoff McFetridge for Apple Watch</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.figma.com\">Figma</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(2,1,'2020-12-29 09:34:17','2021-02-09 08:41:10',NULL,'February 9',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'february-9',NULL,'2021-02-09 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Zapotecs &amp; Pulsars\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>Monte Albán&nbsp;is a pre-Columbian site above <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca\">Oaxaca</a>, in central Mexico which I visited in 2015 with my parents-in-law, who had been there several times before.

The primitive forms and its distinct ceremonial layout makes it easy to cast yourself back in time. Monte Albán was a site for events that marked specific moments in time.

It’s also the only building that is meant to be entered. It was the astronomical observatory and used only by Zapotec astronomers (who were also, in a reason-meets-faith synchrony, Zapotec priests). Members of this sect would enter, look up, read the stars or the sun in the sky, and then emerge to announce what time it was. Time-keeping was a divine act for Zapotecs, received by astronomer-priests directly from the heavens.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00011.png\"><br></div><div>The site is also heavily populated with writing that marks ceremonial sites and events, recording dates from 700 B.C. using the oldest known example of a <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/mesoamerican-calendar-sacred-solar-ritual-rounds-171581\">Mesoamerican calendar</a>.

While there, Olivetti came across a new American invention he had not seen before: the Underwood mechanical typewriter. Olivetti was intrigued. He returned to Ivrea after completing the fellowship and joined up with a couple of childhood friends to set up a new company called Centimetro, Grammo, Secondo to manufacture precision instruments for measuring distance, mass, and time. This was a moment when manufacturing was ramping up in the industrial corridors of northern Italy, so precise devices to measure calibrations of finer and smaller degrees were in demand. It was also important to Olivetti to do this both with his childhood friends and in his hometown—he felt instinctively that a business has a direct responsibility to the context in which it operates. If successful, the company would provide jobs and prosperity to Ivrea. However, it wasn’t.</div><div><br></div><div>And so he returned to California for another stint at Stanford. This time he looked into the typewriter more closely, managed to make contact with people working on the machine, and returned to Italy with a complete set of blueprints. Olivetti set up another new company, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/t-magazine/olivetti-typewriters-ivrea-italy.html\">Olivetti Typewriter Corporation</a>, which would design and manufacture the machines. Related to his thoughts on the responsibilities of a company to its context, he also believed it was important to understand typewriters within the *cultural context of writing,* the way that writing affects society and conversely, the way in which society shapes writing. Writing mechanistically changes things: you no longer use your own hand, one letter might look like another, the machine might even make writing more like factory work. So, although he had the blueprints for the machine, being an engineer Camillo redesigned it from the ground up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_S.p.A.\">The Olivetti typewriter</a> [↙] was a completely different type of writing machine, one whose design aimed to make writing with it more individual, more pleasurable, more human.</div><div><img src=\"/media/00014.png\"><br></div><div>The Olivetti company became pretty successful pretty quickly and built a larger factory. Alongside the idea that its typewriters might make writing by machine more human, <a href=\"https://www.domusweb.it/en/speciali/domusfordesign/2020/i-see-the-factory-as-serving-man-not-man-serving-the-factory-adriano-olivettis-social-project.html\">Olivetti also thought that the company must do something positive for its workers</a>—provide jobs, produce an economic base for his hometown. Famously, the new Olivetti factory building was designed with large windows that face the Italian Alps so that the workers might look at the mountains as they assembled typewriters. Olivetti debuted the typewriter at the Turin International—a kind of World’s Fair dedicated to labor and industry—in 1911, where they showed not only the typewriters but all of the tooling and process plus biographies of the factory workers. It was, and remains, a distinct approach, a convincing approach.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"https://www.i-n-t-e-r-f-a-c-e.org/media/pdf/Design-Interface.pdf\">Design-Interface.pdf</a> (Gianni Barbacetto)</div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/By-Design.pdf\">By-Design.pdf</a> (Alice Rawsthorne)</div><div><br></div><div><div>Resources</div></div><div><a href=\"https://www.domusweb.it/en/speciali/domusfordesign/2020/i-see-the-factory-as-serving-man-not-man-serving-the-factory-adriano-olivettis-social-project.html\">Domus</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/t-magazine/olivetti-typewriters-ivrea-italy.html\">Utopia, Abandoned</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(4,1,'2020-12-29 09:35:13','2021-03-01 17:18:49',NULL,'.March 9 Tetracono',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'march-9-tetracono',NULL,'2021-03-09 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								 “... meet the Tetracono”\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>I want to talk about <a href=\"https://walkerart.org/magazine/meet-the-tetracono\">a design research project</a> that I worked on for the first half of 2017. The main protagonist is Bruno Munari and this will focus on one particular work I find particularly rich.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00015.png\"><br></div><div>In 1965, Italian artist and designer <a href=\"http://www.munart.org\">Bruno Munari</a> released the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZBA0__AyAfI\">Tetracono</a> [↑] with an event and exhibition at the Danese Milano showroom, inviting spectators to—quote—”... meet the Tetracono,” as if it was a person. But Tetracono is a product—an austere, 15-centimeter, black steel cube, housing four aluminum cones, each painted half red and half green, and designed to spin at four different distinct speeds on an 18-minute cycle. Its stated function was to show forms while they were in the process of becoming. My design research work around it included both historical research and also making things today. It was the result of six months spent as a design fellow at the <a href=\"https://www.aarome.org\">American Academy in Rome</a>, where I was given the time and space to investigate something. I’d been interested in this object for a good while and realized that I could talk about everything I wanted to talk about just through this one object. I also thought it’d be nice to spend six months looking at a 15-centimeter box.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, the story begins around 1962. <a href=\"http://munart.org\">Munari</a> was an artist, designer, writer, teacher, definitely an inventor, occasionally a curator. He was trained as an artist in Milan in the beginning of the 20th century. He associated himself with the Italian Futurists in the first quarter of the 20th century, but he came onto the movement late. And, in fact, he kind of quickly departed from some of their ideas.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>He became increasingly disillusioned with fine art as a practice distinct from design or working in the world, at large, and was vocal about it. By 1962 he was writing a regular column in the Milan newspaper, <i>Il Giorno</i>. There, he called on his fellow artists to change their practice:</div><blockquote>Today it’s become necessary to demolish the myth of the star artist.&nbsp;</blockquote><div>He continues,&nbsp;</div><blockquote>Culture today is becoming a mass affair, and the artist must step down from his pedestal and be prepared to make a sign for a butcher’s shop (if he knows how to do it).</blockquote><div>That was a particularly blunt statement of what he had both implied and modeled throughout his career. This was the only way for art to again make contact with the public at large.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Readings<br></div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/The-Tetracone.pdf\">The-Tetracone.pdf</a> (Bruno Munari)<br></div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/What-is-this-X-Hour.pdf\">What-is-this-X-Hour.pdf</a> (Bruno Munari)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"http://munart.org/\">http://munart.org/</a></div><div><a href=\"https://walkerart.org/magazine/meet-the-tetracono\">https://walkerart.org/magazine/meet-the-tetracono</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(5,1,'2020-12-29 09:35:30','2021-03-01 17:19:10',NULL,'.March 9 Arte Programmata',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'march-9-arte-programmata',NULL,'2021-03-09 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Programmed Art<br>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>Around this time, Munari was also working for Olivetti, the Italian typewriter, adding machine, and electronics company. Olivetti had <a href=\"http://servinglibrary.org/journal/7/c-1962\">an ambitious design commissioning program</a> and considered it part of their corporate responsibility to invite artists to work on design projects to inject artists’ particular, alternative points of view into society at large. One of these commissions went to an architect, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/t-magazine/carlo-scarpa.html\">Carlo Scarpa</a>, to design the Olivetti showroom in Venice on the corner of the Piazza San Marco in the city center. The shop was small, refined, and beautiful, presenting Olivetti’s products in a jewel-box setting—surely it was the Apple Store of its day.</div><div><br></div><div>Since working with Olivetti, Munari was increasingly interested in computers, making works of art that engaged the then-new concept of computer programming. Munari proposed to Olivetti to make an art exhibition inside their Milan and Venice showrooms. The show would present the work of two young Italian design collectives, <a href=\"http://www.reprogrammed-art.cc/library/34/Gruppo-T\">Gruppo T</a> and <a href=\"http://www.edueda.net/index.php?title=Gruppo_N\">Gruppo N</a>, together with some of his own work, and the work of designer <a href=\"http://enzomari.com\">Enzo Mari</a>.&nbsp;</div><div>Here is the showroom in Venice [↓].</div><div><img src=\"/media/00016.png\"><br></div><div>The exhibition was called <a href=\"http://www.reprogrammed-art.cc/library/33/Arte-programmata.-Arte-cinetica.-Opere-moltiplicate.-Opera-aperta.\">Arte Programmata</a> (Programmed Art) and the catalogue’s introductory essay by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco\">Umberto Eco</a> describes,&nbsp;</div><blockquote>We can speak of programmed art and admire the kinetic sculptures that&nbsp;a man of the coming future would install in his house in place of the old prints or modern masterpieces reproduced, and if someone should observe this is not painting or even sculpture it should be of no concern.</blockquote><div>Eco continues to describe the qualities of these works. They are produced in multiple—there is never a unique work. They are the scale of tabletop consumer products and are meant to be engaged on a one-to-one basis. They move: many use motors, lights, or even chemicals. Each is governed by a script, a plan of possible arrangements. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iji_cT9L6RQ\">Every work is constantly changing</a>, although within a constrained set of possible arrangements, defined as the artwork’s “program.”</div><div><br></div><div>The programmed art of these young artist collectives worked with the metaphor of computer programming making artworks that followed scripts to produce a constantly changing form. These used motors, fluids, magnets, and electricity in place of actual computers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The artists (they actually called themselves “visual operators”) also had something of a social agenda behind their work, insisting on the production not of unique art objects, but rather of designed multiples produced in open-ended editions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here is the catalog cover [↙].<br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00017.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The artists believed that these artworks-as-consumer-products might circulate in society and inject artistic thinking and specific, new, challenging points of view.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/c-1962.pdf\">c-1962.pdf</a> (David Reinfurt)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"https://youtu.be/iji_cT9L6RQ\">Arte Programmata</a></div></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(6,1,'2020-12-29 09:36:05','2021-03-24 11:15:45',NULL,'April 6',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'april-6',NULL,'2021-04-06 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Design Noir',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>This is a favorite design book [↓] of mine. <i>Design Noir</i>&nbsp;by <a href=\"http://dunneandraby.co.uk/content/projects\">Fiona Raby and Anthony Dunne</a> was published in 2001. My copy is pretty beat up, well-used over any number of years. I always like the way that books with white covers inevitably show their age.</div><div><img src=\"/media/00036.png\"><br></div><div>It seems appropriate given what that the book describes:</div><div><blockquote>Beneath the glossy surface of official design lurks a dark and strange world driven by real human needs. A place where electronic objects co-star in a noir thriller, working with like-minded individuals to escape normalisation and ensure that even a totally manufactured environment has room for danger, adventure and transgression. We don’t think that design can ever fully anticipate the richness of this unofficial world and neither should it. But it can draw inspiration from it and develop new design approaches and roles so that as our new environment evolves, there is still scope for rich and complex human pleasure.</blockquote><blockquote>Corporate futurologists force-feed us a ‘happy-ever-after’ portrayal of life where technology is the solution to every problem. There is no room for doubt or complexity in their techno-utopian visions. Everyone is a stereotype, and social and cultural roles remain unchanged. Despite the fact that technology is evolving, the imagined products that feature in their fantasies reassure us that nothing essential will change, everything will stay the same. These future forecasters have a conservative role, predicting patterns of behaviour in relation to technological developments. They draw from what we already know about people, and weave new ideas into existing realities. The resulting scenarios extend pre-existent reality into the future and so reinforce the status quo rather than challenging it. Their slick surface distracts us from the dystopian vision of life they wish for. By designing the props for the videos produced to show us what the future could be like, design works to keep official values in place.</blockquote><blockquote>An occasional glance through almost any newspaper reveals a very different view of everyday life, where <a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/-9XQbSWr9vUllOvndOnEinMidAftXhdv9e39dPmFY2RUTmsWS0EC4sAoyXeyC03eEEx5MnWpUyLtWFGjrnM7j7_FjCKl42La42hJlrq7BLvbca1t0wsaLXrv7QYpOFgFxcXUy1fnR_ums3WBdLxK1hfsgY44Md-WNI3SIcz2AYbAU92MUA\">complex emotions, desires and needs</a> are played out through the misuse and abuse of electronic products and systems. A mother shoots her son after an argument over which television channel to watch; a parent is outraged by a speaking doll made in China which sounds like it swears; the police set a trap for scanner snoopers — people who listen in to emergency radio frequencies illegally — by broadcasting a message that a UFO has landed in a local forest, within minutes several cars arrive and their scanners are confiscated. Many of these stories illustrate the narrative space entered by using and misusing a simple electronic product, how interaction with everyday electronic technologies can generate rich narratives that challenge the conformity of everyday life by short-circuiting our emotions and states of mind. These stories blend the physical reality of place with electronically mediated experience and mental affect. They form part of a pathology of material culture that includes aberrations, transgressions and obsessions, the consequences of and motivations for the misuse of objects, and object malfunctions.

Although I didn’t get to work on that project, the office was an exceptionally nurturing environment and I was able to observe Harris and others at work on it.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00033.jpg\"><br></div><div>The Citibank ATM that resulted was a first-person interface, addressing the user directly. The interaction started with, “Hello. May I help you?” and then continued to guide a user through the banking process, confirming each step along the way. It was an example of good, clear public interface design [↓].</div><div><img src=\"/media/00034.png\"><br></div><div>When we started work on the MetroCard Automated Vending Machine project, a sequence of screens was already in place. We began by questioning that order and considering alternatives in the flow. The user paths (flows) were complicated and there were a number of possible transactions that the new machine would implement, including buying a multi-ride card, a single ride ticket, adding value to an existing card,&nbsp;</div><div>and even trading in and consolidating cards. Here’s a page from the initial spec document [↓].</div><div><img src=\"/media/00035.png\"><br></div><div>This is a case study of <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/145494/\">an interface designed over 20 years ago</a> and still in use today, fundamentally unchanged. This is a project I worked on, so it will have some personal detail.</div><div><br></div></div><div>A primary goal for the MetroCard interaction was to make the transaction as efficient as possible. Buying a token was a quick, scripted maneuver. It was something you did over and over and over again. So we set several competing conceptual models for how the touchscreen interface would work.<br></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us/\">Continues in class ...</a><br></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/The-Interface-Experience.pdf\">The-Interface-Experience.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Kimon Keramidas)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"http://interface-experience.org\">http://interface-experience.org</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(9,1,'2020-12-29 09:36:48','2021-02-16 10:34:38',NULL,'February 23',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'february-23',NULL,'2021-02-23 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								You Will',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>When <a href=\"http://interface-experience.org\">looking at interfaces</a> I find it particularly useful to look at things that are out of date, that don’t clearly register in the current moment. It’s even better if these are from long enough ago that we’ve forgotten what screens looked like then. Interface design and graphic conventions both change and also cohere incredibly fast, so this isn’t hard.</div><div>Interface design is an explicitly speculative exercise, and so when looking at interfaces from the past we see what the present was supposed to look like. Sometimes these match our current situation, but often they don’t. In either case, the speculative interface design scenarios reveal desires for how we’d like our computers to behave. The fictions suggest uses we may have never known we wanted, but by articulating these as rendered design proposals, they often end up directly forming the interfaces we end up with.</div><div><br></div><div>I’d like to look at a few of these interface design scenarios from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/a2EgfkhC1eo\">a print and television campaign run by AT&amp;T in 1993 called “You Will.”</a> The ads describe and render a collection of interfaces coming sometime in the near future. At the time, these looked impossibly futuristic, but <a href=\"https://about.att.com/newsroom/2018/you_will.html\">now, more than 20 years later</a>, many, even most, are intimately familiar.</div><blockquote>AT&amp;T Ad 1: Have you ever borrowed a book from thousands of miles away? Crossed the country without stopping for directions? Or sent someone a fax from the beach? You will. And the company that will bring it to you, AT&amp;T.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>AT&amp;T Ad 2: Have you ever paid a toll without slowing down? Bought concert tickets from cash machines? Or tucked your baby in from a phone booth? You will. And the company that’ll bring it to you, AT&amp;T.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>AT&amp;T Ad 3: Have you ever opened doors with the sound of your voice? Carried your medical history in your wallet? Or attended a meeting in your bare feet? You will, and the company that will bring it to you, AT&amp;T.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>AT&amp;T Ad 4: Have you ever watched the movie you wanted to the minute you wanted to? Learned special things from faraway places? Or tucked your baby in from a phone booth? You will, and the company that will bring it to you, AT&amp;T.&nbsp;</blockquote><div>What strikes me in watching these is that when working in interface design, the most consequential work doesn’t have a template — there’s no existing model. There are incremental advances in interface design perpetually put forward, like a better button design or a smoother loading widget, but these are driven more by a previous product than a comprehensive reimagination. The incremental designs respond to an existing interaction, rather than asking the more fundamental question of what the interaction could be. An interface can be radically reconceived, even just its visual vocabulary can suggest a completely different use.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here’s one more [↓], a print ad which is particularly relevant.&nbsp;</div></div><div><img src=\"/media/00019.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us/\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/overview/getting-started/\">Apple WatchOS Human Interface Guidelines</a></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/\">Apple Watch Design Resources</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/about/\">Figma</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(10,1,'2020-12-29 09:37:07','2021-03-24 11:15:29',NULL,'March 2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'mach-2',NULL,'2021-03-02 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								A &nbsp;Note on the Time',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>The time right now is 2011 Feb 18 3:34 PM.

At the most fundamental, we deal in form, color, grids, and... type. With a healthy dose of creative thinking, fonts could be seen as behaving like cryptocurrency—they are bits of code which both sender and receiver need to have installed on their computers in order to see the fonts live, and they have a shared value to those users. What if you combined the motives inherent in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_currency\">local currencies</a> with the technology of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency\">cryptocurrency</a>, the mechanics of digital payments, and visual form of fonts? You might get a new system for local digital currencies that allows communities to set up their own network for exchange, where value is expressed both in numbers and in the form of the numbers. By creating a platform for a flexible system, different communities could build economic empowerment and self-reliance (similar to <a href=\"https://berkshares.org\">BerkShares</a> and the <a href=\"https://bristolpound.org\">Bristol pound</a>) or develop a platform to exchange goods and services that are outside of formal markets (similar to the Spice network in the UK). Establishing the currency and its value would be in the hands of the individual groups using it rather than big global data hungry corporations. And similar to the Swiss franc, the visualization of the money can reflect community identity.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Using a different font for the numbers in each currency, means that the money for each community group is unique: the community gets to choose what their exchange looks like and their currency looks different from the next community. Money doesn’t have to look the same for everyone and for every purpose. Digital balances can have meaning besides just the number displayed: a value of 10 between office mates&nbsp;will look different from 10 exchanged at the local market; a heavy font could be selected for something important, a playful font for exchanging with friends. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/us/politics/tubman-20-dollar-bill.html\">And Harriet Tubman can finally get her own currency</a>.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00040.png\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00041.png\"><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00042.png\"><br></div><div>People have long thought of money in different ways—money in a savings account is treated differently than a Holiday bonus, credit card debit is thought of differently than a loan to a friend—font money would allow people to see it differently too.<br></div><div><div><br></div><div>Recently, I find myself drawing a lot of 2s. It seems infinite how many variations you can make while still being legible. Of course, as people start to form exchange communities and choose their own font, people will choose what has value to them.</div><div><br></div><div>Does this solve <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/opinion/brooks-the-inequality-problem.html\">financial inequality</a>? Hardly. But I can’t help but think if there was a consistent yet flexible system for people to set up local exchanges we would inspire more community industry, pay people for work that is often unpaid, be less dependent on big corporations, be able to loan money to neighbors, and be able to see our exchanges as relationships between people rather than between banks. If we can actively participate in creating currency, will that help us see money differently? And would that affect our how we value objects, time, and our fellow human beings?</div></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us/\">Continues in class ...</a><br></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/Fonts-as-Money.pdf\">Fonts-as-Money.pdf</a> (Sarah Gephart)</div><div><br></div><div>Resources<br></div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/Code-an-Essay.pdf\">Code-an-Essay.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Paul Ford)</div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Visitor</div><div><a href=\"https://www.sarahgephart.com\">Sarah Gephart</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(12,1,'2020-12-29 09:38:51','2022-01-19 10:00:50',NULL,'.April 20 Reading a wave',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'april-20-old',NULL,'2021-04-20 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Reading a wave',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>The first story in a collection by Italian writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_Calvino\">Italo Calvino</a> is “Reading a Wave.”&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00031.png\"><br></div><div>It tells the story of the book‘s protagonist, Mr. Palomar, as he attempts to make sense of the ocean he is staring at. The short story begins:</div><blockquote>The sea is barely wrinkled, and little waves strike the sandy shore. Mr. Palomar is standing on the shore, looking at a wave. Not that he is lost in contemplation of the waves. He is not lost, because he is quite aware of what he is doing: he wants to look at a wave and he is looking at it. He is not contemplating, because for contemplation you need the right temperament, the right mood, and the right combination of exterior circumstances; and though Mr. Palomar has nothing against contemplation in principle, none of these three conditions applies to him. Finally, it is not \"the waves\" that he means to look at, but just one individual wave: in his desire to avoid vague sensations, he establishes for his every action a limited and precise object.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Palomar sees a wave rise in the distance, grow, approach, change form and color, fold over itself, break, vanish, and flow again. At this point he could convince himself that he has concluded the operation he had set out to achieve, and he could go away. But isolating one wave is not easy, separating it from the wave immediately following, which seems to push it and at times overtakes it and sweeps it away; and it is no easier to separate that one wave from the preceding wave, which seems to drag it toward the shore, unless it turns against the following wave, as if to arrest it, Then, if you consider the breadth of the wave, parallel to the shore, it is hard to decide where the advancing front extends regularly and where it is separated and segmented into independent waves, distinguished by their speed, shape, force, direction.</blockquote><blockquote>In other words, you cannot observe a wave without bearing in mind the complex features that concur in shaping it and the other, equally complex ones that the wave itself originates.</blockquote></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us/\">Continues in class ...</a><br></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/Reading-a-Wave.pdf\">Reading-a-Wave.pdf</a> (Italo Calvino)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/160292055\">Köln Waves / Blues</a>&nbsp;(Seth Price)</div>\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(13,1,'2020-12-29 09:39:09','2021-03-23 17:08:07',NULL,'April 20',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'april-20',NULL,'2021-04-20 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Desktops &amp; Trashcans',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>This is Muriel Cooper [↓] <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BhrZHkdc2rU\">speaking at the 1994 TED conference</a> in Monterey, California.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00029.png\"><br></div><div>It was the fifth edition of the <a href=\"https://www.ted.com\">Technology, Entertainment, and Design</a> conference founded by information architect Richard Saul Wurman, a close friend and colleague of Cooper’s. The TED conference drew heavy hitters from the overlapping worlds described in its title. Cooper was there to show the most recent interface design work coming out of the Visible Language Workshop in the MIT Media Lab, which she directed. Muriel Cooper’s loose but lucid TED talk looks a thousand miles away from the <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jim_hemerling_5_ways_to_lead_in_an_era_of_constant_change?language=en\">stage-managed, rehearsed, slick, and clickable TED talks</a> on the internet today.&nbsp;</div><blockquote>Muriel Cooper: Thank you. I have a couple of—can you hear me? I have a couple of personal things in characteristic with the TED philosophy. First of all, I’m testing the boundaries to see how truly comfortable one can make oneself here. She takes off her shoes and continues,&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Our goal has been for a very long time to try to examine in the so-called emerging technologies what the new form and content of design, of communication, might be. And to that end for many years we have been building sort of prototype visualization tools that would allow us to do something that seems relatively intuitive in order to say “What if we did this, then what would happen?” but to really visualize this stuff in as tight and iterative loop as we possibly could. So we’re looking for the new design principles, umm, we’re not at all sure what they are ...</blockquote><div>The talk proceeds in a knockabout fashion as Cooper and her student, <a href=\"https://www.smalldesignfirm.com\">David Small</a>, eventually launch into a live demonstration of Information Landscapes, the most recent, and most exciting, work in the Visible Language Workshop. The software demo also goes around in circles a bit, but the work was overwhelmingly convincing to the audience. Spontaneous applause, and even an audible gasp or two, punctuated the presentation. Afterwards, audience member Bill Gates requested a copy, the work appeared on the cover of the design trade magazine I.D., with an article by Janet Abrams, and speaking requests piled up. This work seemed to be everywhere when I was working as a young interaction designer at <a href=\"https://www.ideo.com/location/san-francisco\">IDEO San Francisco</a> at the time.

A video tour of the exhibition, physically mounted in Gander’s new impromptu gallery space, Solid Haus, in Suffolk, England, is available on-demand from February 5 through 26. On February 9 at 12 p.m. (EST) Gander will present a live guided tour of the exhibition and engage in a conversation with Princeton Program in Visual Arts faculty member David Reinfurt via Zoom. The exhibition video and live tour/conversation events are free and open to the public at <a href=\"https://arts.princeton.edu/gander\">arts.princeton.edu/gander</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Gander was one of five artists awarded a highly competitive Princeton Hodder Fellowship for the 2019-20 academic year. Hodder Fellows are writers, composers, choreographers, visual artists, performance artists, or other kinds of artists or humanists who have, as the program outlines, “much more than ordinary intellectual and literary gifts.” Artists from anywhere may apply in the early fall each year for the following academic year. While not required to be present on the Princeton campus, Gander made a few visits from his home in Britain to engage with the Princeton community, including screening his film Me, My Selfie and I in December 2019; mounting an exhibition, The Annotated Reader, early in 2020; and, when travel became a challenge early in the COVID pandemic, presenting a virtual live studio tour from the U.K. last April.<br></blockquote><div>Ryan will join class today from Suffolk and talk a bit about time in his art works.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00049.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>His <a href=\"https://arts.princeton.edu/events/natural-and-conventional-signs-exhibition-tour-by-ryan-gander/\">exhibition</a> remains installed anyway and I think we will also get to virtually tour around it a bit and ask him a few savvy questions such as \"Where are we?\" and &nbsp;\"What time is it, anyway?\"&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us/\">Continues in class ...</a><br></div>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Resources<br></div><div><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/461832743\">These are the markers of our time</a></div><div><a href=\"https://ryanganderarchive.com/access\">https://ryanganderarchive.com</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(18,1,'2021-05-14 11:15:37','2021-05-14 12:20:04',1000,'.videos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'videos',NULL,'2021-04-27 00:00:00','2021-04-27 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<style>\r\niframe {\r\n-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid;

The distinctive voice belongs to Pat Simmons, a former London Telephone Exchange employee who spoke the time from 1963 until 1985. Simmons followed Jane Cain [↓], the “golden voice” of the first British telephone time system starting in 1936.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00007.png\"><br></div><div>That first set up was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rErC-f_ru4c\">a room-sized electric mechanism</a> which produced an automated announcement from glass disk recordings of spoken audio bits. Here is Pat Simmons [↓] recording numbers and sentence fragments.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00006.png\">Dialing “T-I-M” from any UK telephone at the time set this elaborate machine running. Before this, speaking clocks were delivered live by an operator sitting in front of a clock face, answering phone calls, and reading out the time [↓].&nbsp;<br></div><div><img src=\"/media/00008.png\"><br></div><div>Of course what you hear live when you call the number above depends on exactly when you call. The voice, well that’s not so live. Simmons spoke the clock only from 1963 until 1985 and this service is a software simulation run by enthusiasts at <a href=\"https://telephonesuk.org.uk\">telephonesuk.co.uk</a>. Live, recorded, or programmed, a speaking clock is clearly an anachronism. But, it also provides a crisp model for thinking around something quite contemporary: the interface.&nbsp;</div><blockquote>Jane Cain: At the third stroke it will be 8:57 precisely.</blockquote><blockquote>Pat Simmons: At the third stroke it will be 7:02 and forty-seconds.</blockquote><blockquote>Man’s voice: At the third stroke the time sponsored by Accurist will be 10:52 and 10 seconds.&nbsp;<br></blockquote><div>Each has a particular quality and it’s easy enough to imagine those voices as the personality, or even the design, of this interface. Call the speaking clock and you’re interacting with a front end, a “user experience”—you’re given a simple friendly face for a complex process which remains hidden.</div><blockquote>Whatever lies between is called interface. Whatever allows us to link to different elements, to reconcile them, to put them into communication.</blockquote><div>That definition was offered in 1987 by Italian critic Giancarlo Barbacetto in his introduction to <i>Design Interface</i>. The book chronicled the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_S.p.A.\">Olivetti Typewriter Corporation</a>’s early attempts at designing user controls for photocopiers, computers, typewriters, and calculators. Barbacetto places this design task in a broad cultural and temporal context. Appearing opposite his introduction is a reproduction of the Rosetta Stone, offered up as a kind of original, ur-interface—a shared surface which facilitates communication between otherwise irreconcilable languages and cultures. <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-rosetta-stone-1e03509704a3490e99a173e53b93e282\">The Rosetta Stone</a> [↙] records three different languages all relaying the same message. The recovery of this “shared surface” in 1799 allowed the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00009.png\"><br></div><div>Barbacetto continues from the Rosetta Stone to an impossibly broad scoping of the concept of interface and lands on this, a public <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfWz4XwlZOQ\">clocktower in the Piazza San Marco</a> in Venice [↗]. It’s the first public clock and it’s set at the center of a merchant city, where shared time would have significant consequences for shipping and commerce. He goes on,</div><blockquote>An extremely powerful and everyday filter is the clock. The first machine made available to all from high atop a tower ready to interface humans and time. The clock tore humans away from lived time marked by natural rhythms and by the duties of seasonal social labor and delivered into the power of measured time, objective and abstract. The work time of urban merchants, the interest time of the money lender, the factory time of industry. First the bells of the city clocktower, later the mill siren, erased cyclical time that moved, the rhythm of the seasonal return, of a certain kind of game, the ripening of a plant, the dependable rising of the sun. Cyclical time was a great exorcism of death—the moon that returns is the first dead man returning, repetition is the life of the world, history is nothing but the reiteration of a single original event; time is Kronos, the great primordial judge.</blockquote><blockquote>After the arrival of the clock all that became a memory and a myth. Time became linear, homogenous, empty, irreversible, cumulative, oriented towards a goal. Even modern mechanical thought prefers rectilinear motion to circular motion. Clocks mark the separation between work time (the value time of production), and free time, but today even the physicality of the chimes of the clocktower is obscured by the digital information time, the absolute acceleration of the discontinuity in the contemporaneity of computer time.</blockquote><div>Olivetti’s first large computer (built in 1959) was named the Elea, after the colony in Magna Graecia where, in the fifth century B.C. the school of philosophy of Parmenides and Zeno was born. “Elea computer”—the name itself is like saying mathematical rationality and philosophical discourse, algorithm and hermeneutics.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>(“Algorithm and hermeneutics” or in other words, a definite pattern and how things get their meanings.)</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Resources<br></div><div><a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/TIME/gjnvwwjegvw/\">Why time feels so weird in 2020</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/geoff-mcfetridge-apple-watch-series-six-art-digital-180920\">Geoff McFetridge for Apple Watch</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.figma.com\">Figma</a></div><div><br></div><div>Work</div><div><a href=\"/january-24/assignment-1\">Assignment #1, Apple Watch</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(21,1,'2020-12-29 09:34:17','2022-01-21 12:14:16',NULL,'January 31',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'january-31',NULL,'2022-01-31 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Zapotecs &amp; Pulsars\r\n																								',_binary '<div>Monte Albán&nbsp;is a pre-Columbian site above <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca\">Oaxaca</a>, in central Mexico which I visited in 2015 with my parents-in-law, who had been there several times before.

The primitive forms and its distinct ceremonial layout makes it easy to cast yourself back in time. Monte Albán was a site for events that marked specific moments in time.

It’s also the only building that is meant to be entered. It was the astronomical observatory and used only by Zapotec astronomers (who were also, in a reason-meets-faith synchrony, Zapotec priests). Members of this sect would enter, look up, read the stars or the sun in the sky, and then emerge to announce what time it was.

While there, Olivetti came across a new American invention he had not seen before: the Underwood mechanical typewriter. Olivetti was intrigued. He returned to Ivrea after completing the fellowship and joined up with a couple of childhood friends to set up a new company called Centimetro, Grammo, Secondo to manufacture precision instruments for measuring distance, mass, and time. This was a moment when manufacturing was ramping up in the industrial corridors of northern Italy, so precise devices to measure calibrations of finer and smaller degrees were in demand. It was also important to Olivetti to do this both with his childhood friends and in his hometown—he felt instinctively that a business has a direct responsibility to the context in which it operates. If successful, the company would provide jobs and prosperity to Ivrea. However, it wasn’t.</div><div><br></div><div>And so he returned to California for another stint at Stanford. This time he looked into the typewriter more closely, managed to make contact with people working on the machine, and returned to Italy with a complete set of blueprints. Olivetti set up another new company, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/t-magazine/olivetti-typewriters-ivrea-italy.html\">Olivetti Typewriter Corporation</a>, which would design and manufacture the machines. Related to his thoughts on the responsibilities of a company to its context, he also believed it was important to understand typewriters within the *cultural context of writing,* the way that writing affects society and conversely, the way in which society shapes writing. Writing mechanistically changes things: you no longer use your own hand, one letter might look like another, the machine might even make writing more like factory work. So, although he had the blueprints for the machine, being an engineer Camillo redesigned it from the ground up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_S.p.A.\">The Olivetti typewriter</a> [↙] was a completely different type of writing machine, one whose design aimed to make writing with it more individual, more pleasurable, more human.</div><div><img src=\"/media/00014.png\"><br></div><div>The Olivetti company became pretty successful pretty quickly and built a larger factory. Alongside the idea that its typewriters might make writing by machine more human, <a href=\"https://www.domusweb.it/en/speciali/domusfordesign/2020/i-see-the-factory-as-serving-man-not-man-serving-the-factory-adriano-olivettis-social-project.html\">Olivetti also thought that the company must do something positive for its workers</a>—provide jobs, produce an economic base for his hometown. Famously, the new Olivetti factory building was designed with large windows that face the Italian Alps so that the workers might look at the mountains as they assembled typewriters. Olivetti debuted the typewriter at the Turin International—a kind of World’s Fair dedicated to labor and industry—in 1911, where they showed not only the typewriters but all of the tooling and process plus biographies of the factory workers. It was, and remains, a distinct approach, a convincing approach.</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"https://www.i-n-t-e-r-f-a-c-e.org/media/pdf/Design-Interface.pdf\">Design-Interface.pdf</a> (Gianni Barbacetto)</div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/By-Design.pdf\">By-Design.pdf</a> (Alice Rawsthorne)</div><div><br></div><div><div>Resources</div></div><div><a href=\"https://www.domusweb.it/en/speciali/domusfordesign/2020/i-see-the-factory-as-serving-man-not-man-serving-the-factory-adriano-olivettis-social-project.html\">Domus</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/t-magazine/olivetti-typewriters-ivrea-italy.html\">Utopia, Abandoned</a></div><div><br></div><div>Visitors</div><div>Ari Spool &amp; Rob Chabebe, <a href=\"https://eyebodega.com\">EyeBodega</a>, <a href=\"http://enorme.nyc\">ENORMÉ</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(23,1,'2020-12-29 09:36:48','2022-01-21 12:15:33',NULL,'February 14',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'february-14',NULL,'2022-02-14 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								You Will',_binary '<div>When <a href=\"http://interface-experience.org\">looking at interfaces</a> I find it particularly useful to look at things that are out of date, that don’t clearly register in the current moment. It’s even better if these are from long enough ago that we’ve forgotten what screens looked like then. Interface design and graphic conventions both change and also cohere incredibly fast, so this isn’t hard.</div><div>Interface design is an explicitly speculative exercise, and so when looking at interfaces from the past we see what the present was supposed to look like. Sometimes these match our current situation, but often they don’t. In either case, the speculative interface design scenarios reveal desires for how we’d like our computers to behave. The fictions suggest uses we may have never known we wanted, but by articulating these as rendered design proposals, they often end up directly forming the interfaces we end up with.</div><div><br></div><div>I’d like to look at a few of these interface design scenarios from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/a2EgfkhC1eo\">a print and television campaign run by AT&amp;T in 1993 called “You Will.”</a> The ads describe and render a collection of interfaces coming sometime in the near future. At the time, these looked impossibly futuristic, but <a href=\"https://about.att.com/newsroom/2018/you_will.html\">now, more than 20 years later</a>, many, even most, are intimately familiar.</div><blockquote>AT&amp;T Ad 1: Have you ever borrowed a book from thousands of miles away? Crossed the country without stopping for directions? Or sent someone a fax from the beach? You will. And the company that will bring it to you, AT&amp;T.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>AT&amp;T Ad 2: Have you ever paid a toll without slowing down? Bought concert tickets from cash machines? Or tucked your baby in from a phone booth? You will. And the company that’ll bring it to you, AT&amp;T.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>AT&amp;T Ad 3: Have you ever opened doors with the sound of your voice? Carried your medical history in your wallet? Or attended a meeting in your bare feet? You will, and the company that will bring it to you, AT&amp;T.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>AT&amp;T Ad 4: Have you ever watched the movie you wanted to the minute you wanted to? Learned special things from faraway places? Or tucked your baby in from a phone booth? You will, and the company that will bring it to you, AT&amp;T.&nbsp;</blockquote><div>What strikes me in watching these is that when working in interface design, the most consequential work doesn’t have a template — there’s no existing model. There are incremental advances in interface design perpetually put forward, like a better button design or a smoother loading widget, but these are driven more by a previous product than a comprehensive reimagination. The incremental designs respond to an existing interaction, rather than asking the more fundamental question of what the interaction could be. An interface can be radically reconceived, even just its visual vocabulary can suggest a completely different use.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here’s one more [↓], a print ad which is particularly relevant.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00019.jpg\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us/\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/overview/getting-started/\">Apple WatchOS Human Interface Guidelines</a></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/\">Apple Watch Design Resources</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/about/\">Figma</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(24,1,'2020-12-29 09:37:07','2022-01-21 12:16:01',NULL,'February 21',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'february-21',NULL,'2022-02-21 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								A &nbsp;Note on the Time',_binary '<div>The time right now is 2011 Feb 18 3:34 PM.

The main protagonist is Bruno Munari and this will focus on one particular work I find particularly rich.&nbsp;</div><div><img src=\"/media/00015.png\"><br></div><div>In 1965, Italian artist and designer <a href=\"http://www.munart.org\">Bruno Munari</a> released the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZBA0__AyAfI\">Tetracono</a> [↑] with an event and exhibition at the Danese Milano showroom, inviting spectators to—quote—”... meet the Tetracono,” as if it was a person. But Tetracono is a product—an austere, 15-centimeter, black steel cube, housing four aluminum cones, each painted half red and half green, and designed to spin at four different distinct speeds on an 18-minute cycle. Its stated function was to show forms while they were in the process of becoming. My design research work around it included both historical research and also making things today. It was the result of six months spent as a design fellow at the <a href=\"https://www.aarome.org\">American Academy in Rome</a>, where I was given the time and space to investigate something. I’d been interested in this object for a good while and realized that I could talk about everything I wanted to talk about just through this one object. I also thought it’d be nice to spend six months looking at a 15-centimeter box.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, the story begins around 1962. <a href=\"http://munart.org\">Munari</a> was an artist, designer, writer, teacher, definitely an inventor, occasionally a curator. He was trained as an artist in Milan in the beginning of the 20th century. He associated himself with the Italian Futurists in the first quarter of the 20th century, but he came onto the movement late. And, in fact, he kind of quickly departed from some of their ideas.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>He became increasingly disillusioned with fine art as a practice distinct from design or working in the world, at large, and was vocal about it. By 1962 he was writing a regular column in the Milan newspaper, <i>Il Giorno</i>. There, he called on his fellow artists to change their practice:</div><blockquote>Today it’s become necessary to demolish the myth of the star artist.&nbsp;</blockquote><div>He continues,&nbsp;</div><blockquote>Culture today is becoming a mass affair, and the artist must step down from his pedestal and be prepared to make a sign for a butcher’s shop (if he knows how to do it).</blockquote><div>That was a particularly blunt statement of what he had both implied and modeled throughout his career. This was the only way for art to again make contact with the public at large.</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Readings<br></div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/The-Tetracone.pdf\">The-Tetracone.pdf</a> (Bruno Munari)<br></div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/What-is-this-X-Hour.pdf\">What-is-this-X-Hour.pdf</a> (Bruno Munari)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"http://munart.org/\">http://munart.org/</a></div><div><a href=\"https://walkerart.org/magazine/meet-the-tetracono\">https://walkerart.org/magazine/meet-the-tetracono</a></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(26,1,'2021-02-16 13:15:49','2022-01-21 10:36:12',NULL,'March 14',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'march-14',NULL,'2022-03-14 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Antenna Design',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><a href=\"https://antennadesign.com\">Antenna Design</a> was founded in 1997 by Masamichi Udagawa and Sigi Moeslinger.

We don’t think that design can ever fully anticipate the richness of this unofficial world and neither should it. But it can draw inspiration from it and develop new design approaches and roles so that as our new environment evolves, there is still scope for rich and complex human pleasure.</blockquote><blockquote>Corporate futurologists force-feed us a ‘happy-ever-after’ portrayal of life where technology is the solution to every problem. There is no room for doubt or complexity in their techno-utopian visions. Everyone is a stereotype, and social and cultural roles remain unchanged. Despite the fact that technology is evolving, the imagined products that feature in their fantasies reassure us that nothing essential will change, everything will stay the same. These future forecasters have a conservative role, predicting patterns of behaviour in relation to technological developments. They draw from what we already know about people, and weave new ideas into existing realities. The resulting scenarios extend pre-existent reality into the future and so reinforce the status quo rather than challenging it. Their slick surface distracts us from the dystopian vision of life they wish for. By designing the props for the videos produced to show us what the future could be like, design works to keep official values in place.</blockquote><blockquote>An occasional glance through almost any newspaper reveals a very different view of everyday life, where <a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/-9XQbSWr9vUllOvndOnEinMidAftXhdv9e39dPmFY2RUTmsWS0EC4sAoyXeyC03eEEx5MnWpUyLtWFGjrnM7j7_FjCKl42La42hJlrq7BLvbca1t0wsaLXrv7QYpOFgFxcXUy1fnR_ums3WBdLxK1hfsgY44Md-WNI3SIcz2AYbAU92MUA\">complex emotions, desires and needs</a> are played out through the misuse and abuse of electronic products and systems. A mother shoots her son after an argument over which television channel to watch; a parent is outraged by a speaking doll made in China which sounds like it swears; the police set a trap for scanner snoopers — people who listen in to emergency radio frequencies illegally — by broadcasting a message that a UFO has landed in a local forest, within minutes several cars arrive and their scanners are confiscated. Many of these stories illustrate the narrative space entered by using and misusing a simple electronic product, how interaction with everyday electronic technologies can generate rich narratives that challenge the conformity of everyday life by short-circuiting our emotions and states of mind. These stories blend the physical reality of place with electronically mediated experience and mental affect. They form part of a pathology of material culture that includes aberrations, transgressions and obsessions, the consequences of and motivations for the misuse of objects, and object malfunctions. They provide glimpses of another more complex reality hidden beneath the slick surface of electronic consumerism.</blockquote></div><div><a href=\"https://princeton.zoom.us/\">Continues in class ...</a></div>\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>Reading</div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/Design-Noir.pdf\">Design Noir</a>&nbsp;(Fiona Raby and Anthony Dunne)</div><div><a href=\"/media/pdf/Speculative-Everything.pdf\">Speculative Everything</a>&nbsp;(Fiona Raby and Anthony Dunne)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources</div><div><a href=\"http://dunneandraby.co.uk/\">http://dunneandraby.co.uk/</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1995/11/how-to-build-scenarios\">How to Build Scenarios</a>&nbsp;(Wired)<br></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(29,0,'2020-12-29 09:38:39','2022-01-21 12:28:25',NULL,'April 4',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'april-4',NULL,'2022-04-04 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Time as money as fonts',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div><div>As I meandered through my research, I kept thinking about what skill set designers could bring to <a href=\"https://inequality.stanford.edu/publications/20-facts-about-us-inequality-everyone-should-know\">the inequality problem</a>.

The TED conference drew heavy hitters from the overlapping worlds described in its title. Cooper was there to show the most recent interface design work coming out of the Visible Language Workshop in the MIT Media Lab, which she directed. Muriel Cooper’s loose but lucid TED talk looks a thousand miles away from the <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jim_hemerling_5_ways_to_lead_in_an_era_of_constant_change?language=en\">stage-managed, rehearsed, slick, and clickable TED talks</a> on the internet today.&nbsp;</div><blockquote>Muriel Cooper: Thank you.

First of all, I’m testing the boundaries to see how truly comfortable one can make oneself here. She takes off her shoes and continues,&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Our goal has been for a very long time to try to examine in the so-called emerging technologies what the new form and content of design, of communication, might be. And to that end for many years we have been building sort of prototype visualization tools that would allow us to do something that seems relatively intuitive in order to say “What if we did this, then what would happen?” but to really visualize this stuff in as tight and iterative loop as we possibly could. So we’re looking for the new design principles, umm, we’re not at all sure what they are ...</blockquote><div>The talk proceeds in a knockabout fashion as Cooper and her student, <a href=\"https://www.smalldesignfirm.com\">David Small</a>, eventually launch into a live demonstration of Information Landscapes, the most recent, and most exciting, work in the Visible Language Workshop. The software demo also goes around in circles a bit, but the work was overwhelmingly convincing to the audience. Spontaneous applause, and even an audible gasp or two, punctuated the presentation. Afterwards, audience member Bill Gates requested a copy, the work appeared on the cover of the design trade magazine I.D., with an article by Janet Abrams, and speaking requests piled up. This work seemed to be everywhere when I was working as a young interaction designer at <a href=\"https://www.ideo.com/location/san-francisco\">IDEO San Francisco</a> at the time.

The one more thing was Apple Watch, a hotly anticipated hardware which took the outer form of a standard wristwatch but whose functional relationship to a wristwatch was that of the iPhone to a rotary-dial hard-wired Bell telephone. The Apple Watch is of both the future and the past, impossibly retrograde and fantastically forward-pointing. Apple Watch can send email, transcribe and send text messages, show the next events on a calendar, navigate step-by-step to a destination, forecast the weather, keep track of daily exercise, measure and record heartbeats, play podcasts, Apple Pay for goods and services, and so on. Many of its functions were familiar from the iPhone, but the way in which these were now presented to the user was entirely novel. For example, Calendar was reconceived from the spatial metaphor of a month at time, days organized on a two-dimensional grid to a temporal sequence of notifications delivered over the course of a day. Messages was also redesigned from a digressive, interactive chat tool to a more immediate and lower bandwidth channel to encourage brief replies with templated responses such as “Hello!” “What’s up?” and “On my way.” These changes, accommodations to the small screen size and bodily location, were interface design changes. The interface is a collection of choices and together these form a specific point of view which has consequences on how the watch is used.</div><div><br></div><div>Using the existing Apple Watch Human Interface guidelines and departing from the conventions only if and when necessary should help projects be more comparable from one student to another, as well as more plausible within the existing Apple Watch interface. As it turns out, redesign of the Apple Watch clock face is the one part of the interface which Apple has identified as off-limits to third-party developers.</div></div>\r\n																								\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(35,1,'2022-01-21 12:19:41','2022-01-21 12:28:48',NULL,'April 4',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'april-4',NULL,'2022-04-04 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								Time as money as fonts\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>As I meandered through my research, I kept thinking about what skill set designers could bring to <a href=\"https://inequality.stanford.edu/publications/20-facts-about-us-inequality-everyone-should-know\">the inequality problem</a>.

Hardly. But I can’t help but think if there was a consistent yet flexible system for people to set up local exchanges we would inspire more community industry, pay people for work that is often unpaid, be less dependent on big corporations, be able to loan money to neighbors, and be able to see our exchanges as relationships between people rather than between banks. If we can actively participate in creating currency, will that help us see money differently? And would that affect our how we value objects, time, and our fellow human beings?</div>\r\n\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								<div>Reading</div>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"/media/pdf/Fonts-as-Money.pdf\">Fonts-as-Money.pdf</a> (Sarah Gephart)</div>\r\n\r\n<div><br></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Resources<br></div>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"/media/pdf/Code-an-Essay.pdf\">Code-an-Essay.pdf</a>&nbsp;(Paul Ford)</div>																								\r\n																								');
